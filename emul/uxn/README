This is a uxn port of Collapse OS. This was developed as a
proof of concept to test the flexibility of the HAL.

This port runs on its own vendored version of uxn that has a
few modifications. See uxn/MODS.

To build, run "make" here. It will buils "forth.rom" and
"uxncli". You can then run Collapse OS with "./uxncli forth.rom"

This port is limited: it has no grid subsystem, no BLK
subsystem. But otherwise, it works as with any other port.

Because the uxn VM has no register, it makes its port a bit
special and its "register roles" irregular. PS TOS is the "w"
register, but it makes the whole stack management very...
special. You have to keep in mind that our PS, at all times,
starts with the 2nd element. There is *always* a "w" element
on PS and the rare times we empty PS, it's to put back a "w"
element right away. The whole code expects this.

* PS TOS element is "w"
* PS 2nd element is "p"
* PS 3rd element is "f"
* RS TOS is "r"
* IP is in SYSVARS+$0c
* Z flag is in ZeroPage+$12
* C flag is in ZeroPage+$13

The uxn assembler and HAL port are in uxn.fs, the base native
words are directly in xcomp.fs.
