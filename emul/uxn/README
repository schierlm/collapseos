Because the uxn VM has no register, it makes its port a bit
special and its "register roles" irregular. Because of the way
the HAL is organized, we cannot simply say that PS' TOS is our
"W" register, which means we have to keep it in memory, which
makes the uxn HAL layer extremely inefficient.

* ZeroPage+$10 is "w"
* PS TOS element is "p"
* PS 2nd element is "f"
* RS TOS is "r"
* IP is in SYSVARS+$0c
